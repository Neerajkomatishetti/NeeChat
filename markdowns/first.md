# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks, introduced in React 16.8, are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components, eliminating the need for class components in many cases. They simplify code, improve reusability, and make it easier to manage component logic.

## What Are Hooks?

Hooks are special functions provided by React that allow you to "hook into" React features like state, lifecycle methods, and context from functional components. They let you manage stateful logic and side effects without writing classes.

## Why Use Hooks?

- **Simpler Code**: Functional components with hooks are more concise than class components.
- **Reusable Logic**: Hooks allow you to extract and share logic between components.
- **No this Keyword**: Avoids confusion with this binding in class components.
- **Better Organization**: Group related logic together instead of splitting it across lifecycle methods.

## Core React Hooks

Below are the most commonly used built-in hooks, with explanations and examples.

### 1. useState

The useState hook lets you add state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

- `state`: The current state value.
- `setState`: A function to update the state, triggering a re-render.
- `initialState`: The initial value of the state (can be a value, object, or function).

**Example:**
A counter component that increments or decrements a value:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Notes:**

- useState can manage any type of data: numbers, strings, arrays, objects, etc.
- Always use the setter function (setCount) to update state, not direct mutation.
- For complex state updates, pass a function to setState to ensure you're working with the latest state: `setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);`

### 2. useEffect

The useEffect hook handles side effects in functional components, such as fetching data, updating the DOM, or subscribing to events. It runs after every render by default.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

- The first argument is a function containing the side effect.
- The optional return function handles cleanup (e.g., clearing timers or subscriptions).
- The second argument is an array of dependencies. The effect runs only when these dependencies change.

**Example:**
Fetching data from an API when the component mounts:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function DataFetcher() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));

    // Cleanup (optional, e.g., for aborting fetch)
    return () => {
      // Cleanup logic
    };
  }, []); // Empty array means this runs once on mount

  return <div>{data ? JSON.stringify(data) : "Loading..."}</div>;
}
```

**Key Notes:**

- An empty dependency array (`[]`) makes the effect run only once (like componentDidMount).
- Omitting the dependency array makes the effect run after every render.
- Include all values used in the effect in the dependency array to avoid bugs.

### 3. useContext

The useContext hook lets you access a React context (global state) without wrapping components in a Consumer.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const value = useContext(MyContext);
```

**Example:**
Using a theme context to style a component:

```javascript
import React, { useContext, createContext } from "react";

const ThemeContext = createContext("light");

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button style={{ background: theme === "light" ? "#fff" : "#333" }}>
      Themed Button
    </button>
  );
}
```

**Key Notes:**

- Use useContext to avoid prop drilling for global data like themes or user info.
- Ensure the component is within a Provider for the context, or it will use the default value.

### 4. useReducer

The useReducer hook is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. It's similar to Redux but built into React.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

- `reducer`: A function `(state, action) => newState` that determines how state changes.
- `dispatch`: A function to send actions to the reducer.
- `initialState`: The initial state.

**Example:**
A counter with more complex logic:

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Notes:**

- Use useReducer when state transitions are complex or involve multiple sub-values.
- It's great for predictable state updates, similar to Redux.

## Other Built-in Hooks

React provides additional hooks for specific use cases:

- **useCallback**: Memoizes a function to prevent unnecessary re-creations.

  ```javascript
  const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    doSomething(a, b);
  }, [a, b]);
  ```

- **useMemo**: Memoizes a computed value to avoid expensive calculations.

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

- **useRef**: Creates a mutable reference that persists across renders.

  ```javascript
  const myRef = useRef(null);
  ```

- **useImperativeHandle**: Customizes the instance value exposed when using ref.
- **useLayoutEffect**: Like useEffect, but runs synchronously after DOM updates.
- **useDebugValue**: Displays a label for custom hooks in React DevTools.

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own hooks to extract reusable logic. Custom hooks are just functions that use other hooks.

**Example:**
A custom hook to track window size:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function useWindowSize() {
  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setWindowSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  }, []);

  return windowSize;
}

// Usage
function MyComponent() {
  const { width, height } = useWindowSize();
  return (
    <div>
      Window size: {width}x{height}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Notes:**

- Custom hooks must start with `use` (e.g., useWindowSize).
- They can call other hooks and encapsulate complex logic.
- Share custom hooks across components or projects for reusability.

## Rules of Hooks

To ensure hooks work correctly, follow these rules:

1. **Only Call Hooks at the Top Level**: Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
2. **Only Call Hooks from React Functional Components or Custom Hooks**: Don't use hooks in regular JavaScript functions.
3. Use the ESLint plugin `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` to enforce these rules.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Hooks Simple**: Break complex logic into custom hooks for readability.
- **Minimize Dependencies in useEffect**: Only include necessary dependencies to avoid unnecessary re-runs.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Name custom hooks clearly (e.g., useFetchData).
- **Clean Up Effects**: Always return a cleanup function in useEffect for subscriptions or timers.
- **Avoid Overusing useMemo/useCallback**: Only use them when performance issues arise.

## Conclusion

React Hooks revolutionize how we write components by making functional components more powerful and expressive. By mastering useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, and custom hooks, you can build cleaner, more maintainable React applications. Start small with useState and useEffect, then explore other hooks and custom hooks as your needs grow.
